# FuturisticExample

## Experience

NX Console extension fails to stay up to date with workspace configuration (still seeing removed libraries and not seeing new apps)

Unable to switch from "cjs" to "esm" format in apollo app. Prevents using top-level await and other es2022 features

Can't configure build to use the prisma.schema file

## Development server

Run `nx serve client` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Remote caching

Run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to enable [remote caching](https://nx.app) and make CI faster.
